If you want to translate SVG Cleaner to your native language:

    1) add new string to the translations/translations.pri file. 
       TRANSLATIONS += translations/svgcleaner_(your country code).ts

       For example: translations/svgcleaner_ru.ts

    2) run "lupdate" from console or from Qt Creator (with SVG Cleaner source)
       "Tools -> External -> Linguist -> Update translations (lupdate)".
       This will create new file in "translations" folder with name, that you select in "translations.pri" file.

    3) Open this file with "Qt Linguist" and now you can start translating.
